# urltitle
**urltitle** uses Python 3.7 to return the page title or header-based description for a given URL.
Its intended primary use is the inclusion of the returned value in conversations.
As a disclaimer, note that the returned title is not guaranteed to be accurate due to many possible factors.

## Features
* An in-memory cache is used with a default entry expiration of a week. The cache size and time are customizable.
* Approximately only the fraction of a HTML page required to return a title is read, up to a customizable maximum of 1 MiB.
* A fallback to the `og:title` and `twitter:title` if the `title` tag is unavailable.
* A PDF title metadata extractor is used for PDF files of up to a customizable maximum size of 8 MiB.
* Up to three attempts are made for resiliency except if there is an unrecoverable error, i.e. 400, 401, 404, etc.
* A guess of `https` and otherwise `http` is made for a URL with a missing scheme, e.g. git-scm.com/downloads.
* SSL verification for https sites can optionally be disabled.
* A fallback to Google web cache is used if a HTML page presents a Distil captcha.
It is also used for a PDF which is too large or doesn't have title metadata.
* Diagnostic logging can be optionally enabled for the logger named `urltitle` at the desired level.
* Some site-specific customizations are configurable:
  - Regular expression based URL and title substitutions
  - Use of Google web cache
  - User-Agent
  - Additional headers
  - CSS title selector
  - Use of `og:title` or `twitter:title` over `title` tag
  - Initial read size

### Exceptions
An error is expected to raise the `urltitle.URLTitleError` exception.

### Customizations
For any site-specific customizations, update (but ideally not replace) 
`urltitle.config.NETLOC_OVERRIDES` with the relevant sites using the preexisting entries in it as examples. 
Refer to [`overrides.py`](urltitle/config/overrides.py).
The site of a URL is as defined and returned by the `URLTitleReader().netloc(url)` method in
[`urltitle.py`](urltitle/urltitle.py).

The following examples show various URLs and their corresponding sites for the purpose of entering site-specific
customizations:

| URL | Site |
